# 📦 Archive Directory

This directory contains legacy firmware versions, deprecated code, and historical implementations for reference and backup purposes.

## 📁 Directory Structure

### 🗂️ `/legacy_versions`

Previous firmware implementations and deprecated code:

- `droneTelemetryMotorPID.ino` - Early PID implementation with telemetry
- `DroneWithRealSensors.ino` - Initial sensor integration version
- `flight_controller-v2.cpp` - Second generation flight controller
- `flight_controller.cpp` - Original flight controller implementation
- `remote_control.cpp` - Early remote control implementation
- `remote_controller.cpp` - Previous remote controller version
- `droneFlightController.cpp` - Legacy flight controller test version

## 🎯 Purpose

This archive serves multiple purposes:

- **Version History** - Track evolution of the flight controller system
- **Reference Code** - Access previous implementations for comparison
- **Backup Safety** - Maintain working versions as fallback options
- **Learning Resource** - Study development progression and decisions

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Legacy code may not compile** with current library versions
- **Hardware pinouts may differ** from current implementation
- **Safety features may be incomplete** in older versions
- **Use current firmware** (`firmware/`) for active development

## 🔄 Maintenance

- Archive versions are preserved as-is for historical reference
- No active maintenance or updates are performed on archived code
- Critical security or safety fixes may warrant archival updates
- Documentation focuses on current implementation in main directories
