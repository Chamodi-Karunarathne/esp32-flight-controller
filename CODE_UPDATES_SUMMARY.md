# Updated Code Summary

## Changes Made to Meet Your Specifications

### ✅ **Remote Controller** (`remote_controller.cpp`)

**Updated to match your exact hardware specifications from README.md:**

#### **Pin Assignments (Corrected):**

- **Joystick 1** (Throttle/Yaw):

  - X-axis: GPIO 34
  - Y-axis: GPIO 35
  - Button: GPIO 32

- **Joystick 2** (Roll/Pitch):

  - X-axis: GPIO 36
  - Y-axis: GPIO 39
  - Button: GPIO 33 (noted as not functioning well)

- **Toggle Switches** (pin1 to GND):

  - Switch 1: GPIO 27
  - Switch 2: GPIO 14

- **NRF24L01** (SPI):

  - CE: GPIO 4
  - CSN: GPIO 5
  - SCK: GPIO 18, MOSI: GPIO 23, MISO: GPIO 19

- **I2C Display**:
  - SDA: GPIO 21
  - SCL: GPIO 22

#### **Features:**

- ✅ NRF24L01 ACK payload telemetry reception
- ✅ Firebase Realtime Database integration
- ✅ Joystick calibration with deadband logic
- ✅ Toggle switch support (connects to GND)
- ✅ WiFi connection with retry logic
- ✅ Real-time telemetry display via Serial Monitor
- ✅ Control data transmission at 20Hz
- ✅ Firebase upload every 5 seconds

### ✅ **Drone Code** (`flight_controller_telemetry_only.cpp`)

**Already working correctly with enhanced debugging:**

#### **Features:**

- ✅ All sensors initialized (AHT21, BME280, BH1750, ENS160, GPS, UV sensor)
- ✅ NRF24L01 ACK payload transmission
- ✅ 30-byte telemetry packet (fits in 32-byte limit)
- ✅ Hardware Serial2 for GPS (GPIO 16)
- ✅ Battery voltage monitoring (GPIO 35)
- ✅ Enhanced error handling for ENS160 I2C issues
- ✅ Periodic status messages every 5 seconds
- ✅ Real sensor data collection and transmission

### ✅ **Library Dependencies** (`platformio.ini`)

**Added Firebase library:**

- `mobizt/Firebase ESP32 Client@^4.4.14`

## **Communication Status**

**✅ WORKING:** The drone is successfully receiving control data and sending telemetry back via ACK payloads.

**From your last test:**

```
Drone: Control received - Throttle: 0, Roll: 0, Pitch: 0, Yaw: 0
Drone: Telemetry sent as ACK payload: [Real sensor data]
```

## **Next Steps**

### **1. Upload Remote Controller Code:**

1. Copy `src/remote_controller.cpp` to `src/main.cpp`
2. Upload to your remote ESP32
3. Open Serial Monitor

### **2. Expected Remote Output:**

```
Weather Drone Remote Controller Starting...
WiFi connected! IP address: X.X.X.X
Firebase connected successfully!
Joystick calibration complete!
Control data sent successfully - T:0 R:0 P:0 Y:0
ACK payload available, size: 30
Telemetry data received successfully!
```

### **3. Test Communication:**

- Move joysticks → should see control values change
- Toggle switches → should see switch states in output
- Firebase → telemetry should upload every 5 seconds

## **Hardware Verification Checklist**

### **Remote Controller:**

- [ ] Joystick 1 → GPIO 34, 35, 32
- [ ] Joystick 2 → GPIO 36, 39, 33
- [ ] Toggle switches → GPIO 27, 14 (to GND)
- [ ] NRF24L01 → CE:4, CSN:5, SPI pins
- [ ] Power: 3.3V regulated (NOT from ESP32)

### **Drone:**

- [ ] NRF24L01 → Same pin configuration
- [ ] GPS → TX to GPIO 16
- [ ] All I2C sensors → GPIO 21/22
- [ ] Battery monitoring → GPIO 35
- [ ] UV sensor → GPIO 36

The code now matches your exact specifications and should work with your hardware setup. Both compilation errors have been fixed, and the communication protocol is working as demonstrated by your drone logs.
